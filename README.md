### Sample Dax Measures

-- Total Employees
TotalEmployees = COUNTROWS('Employees')

-- Attrition Count
AttritionCount = CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS('Employees'),
    'Employees'[Attrition] = "Yes"
)

-- Active Employees
ActiveEmployees = TotalEmployees - AttritionCount

-- Attrition Rate (%)
AttritionRatePct = 
DIVIDE(
    [AttritionCount],
    [TotalEmployees],
    0
) * 100

-- Average Tenure (Years)
AverageTenureYears = AVERAGE('Employees'[TenureYears])

-- Attrition Rate by Department (%)
AttritionRateByDept = 
VAR DeptTotal = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('Employees'), ALLEXCEPT('Employees', 'Employees'[Department]))
VAR DeptAttr = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('Employees'), 'Employees'[Attrition] = "Yes", ALLEXCEPT('Employees', 'Employees'[Department]))
RETURN
    DIVIDE(DeptAttr, DeptTotal, 0) * 100

-- Trend of Attrition Over Time (Monthly)
AttritionByMonth = 
SUMMARIZE(
    'Employees',
    'Employees'[YearMonth],   -- assuming you have a YearMonth column (like YYYY-MM)
    "AttritionCount", CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('Employees'), 'Employees'[Attrition] = "Yes"),
    "TotalCount", COUNTROWS('Employees')
)
